[00:53.733] I got caught up in this fame and all these hoes, I let it tempt me
[00:56.819] In that hotel room alone, remember I would hold you gently
[00:59.868] Went on dates, we took some pictures, everything was movin' quickly
[01:02.871] Manipulated, I ain't think a new relationship would fit me
[01:05.782] But I told you we can try it, even though I know it's risky
[01:08.918] Mind games with our emotions, swear this shit get kinda tricky
[01:12.183] Girl, you got me losin' my mind
[01:14.007] I just want you to see that I'm trying
[01:18.120] Ever since you left, the sun don't shine
[01:21.020] Don't want to lose you in this race against time
[01:23.937] Hypnotized by your love, I'm blind
[01:27.057] It's so hard to pay attention to the signs
[01:30.089] Without you, feel like slowly, I'm dying
[01:33.140] Broken hearts can make a grown man cry
[01:36.137]
[01:36.284] [Verse 2]
[01:36.752] Keep her in 'cause I like how them joggers fit her
[01:39.224] Wonderin' how I'ma play it, it was hard to get her
[01:42.257] So beautiful, I keep her smilin' when I compliment her
[01:45.308] If bein' this bad is a sin, I hope that God forgive her
[01:48.408] Just had a son, I'm tryna be the perfect father figure
[01:51.473] I kept you worried, in them trenches tryna dodge the killers
[01:54.393] Tryna escape from this commitment made our problems bigger
[01:57.459] It's hard to love with dysfunction, wish my scars was thinner
[02:00.529] Tryna forgive me in your thoughts, I hope your heart remember
[02:03.580] Know it's gon' hurt to see another nigga bondin' with her
[02:06.710] Can't even look you in your eyes 'cause I'm burnin' up with guilt
[02:09.908] For that one moment, went to far, and now I ****ed up what we built
[02:13.073] Girl, you got me losin' my mind
[02:16.227] I just want you to see that I'm trying
[02:19.128] Ever since you left, the sun don't shine
[02:22.246] Don't want to lose you in this race against time
[02:25.279] Hypnotized by your love, I'm blind
[02:28.380] It's so hard to pay attention to the signs
[02:31.463] Without you, feel like slowly, I'm dying
[02:34.480] Broken hearts can make a grown man cry
[00:00.14]You're all alone at a party, you wanna dance with somebody
[00:04.38]But you ain't got a clue how to ask
[00:08.28]You and your girl had a fight and now she's sayin' goodbye
[00:12.91]She ran upstairs and packed her bags
[00:16.76]It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
[00:21.43]You could be stressed about your work situation
[00:25.82]Ain't gotta listen to me, but all I'm sayin'
[00:29.26]Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
[00:33.70]Ain't no pain, it can't wash away
[00:37.45]From the moment that it hits your lips
[00:41.66]Makes those clouds look a little less grey
[00:46.31]Oh, you could be lonely
[00:49.91]Or heartbroken
[00:51.75]Or hungover from the night before
[00:55.62]Turn that frown into a smile real quick
[00:58.44]There ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
[01:04.09]You're on a lake and you're fishin'
[01:07.07]It's hot and all that you're gettin'
[01:09.14]Is a little nibble here and there
[01:12.96]You're sitttin' watchin' your team
[01:15.51]Losin' that championship ring
[01:17.83]And you're feelin like life ain't fair
[01:21.54]It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
[01:26.11]You could be stressed about your work situation
[01:29.95]Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
[01:33.39]Ain't no pain, it can't wash away
[01:37.72]From the moment that it hits your lips
[01:41.83]Makes those clouds look a little less grey
[01:46.44]Oh, you could be lonely
[01:50.12]Or heartbroken
[01:52.28]Or hungover from the night before
[01:56.17]Turn that frown into a smile real quick
[01:58.93]Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix (Yeehaw!)
[02:22.47]It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
[02:26.94]You could be stressed about your work situation
[02:30.93]Ain't gotta save it for a special occasion
[02:34.86]Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
[02:38.54]Ain't no pain, it can't wash away, no
[02:43.36]From the moment that it hits your lips
[02:47.03]Makes those clouds look a little less grey
[02:51.97]Oh, you could be lonely (Lonely)
[02:55.44]Or heartbroken (Heartbroken)
[02:57.53]Or hungover from the night before
[03:00.96]Turn that frown into a smile real quick
[03:04.11]It might take one or it might take six
[03:08.78]Drink it down, it will do the trick
[03:13.58]Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
[00:00.10]I fell by the wayside like everyone else
[00:06.18]I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself
[00:10.21]Our every moment, I start to replace
[00:14.66]'Cause now that they're gone all I hear were the words that I needed to say
[00:18.72]When you hurt under the surface
[00:23.08]Like troubled water running cold
[00:28.55]Well, time can heal but this won't
[00:34.07]So, before you go
[00:42.00]Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
[00:48.55]If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
[00:52.59]So, before you go
[00:59.16]Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
[01:05.53]It kills me how your mind could make you feel so worthless
[01:09.94]So, before you go
[01:19.20]Was never the right time whenever you called
[01:23.32]Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
[01:27.58]Our every moment, I start to replay
[01:32.05]But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
[01:36.20]When you hurt under the surface
[01:39.96]Like troubled water running cold
[01:45.53]Well, time can heal but this won't
[01:52.07]So, before you go
[01:59.28]Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
[02:05.34]If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
[02:10.01]So, before you go
[02:15.82]Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
[02:22.71]It kills me how your mind could make you feel so worthless
[02:27.05]So, before you go
[02:32.01]Would we be better off by now
[02:36.47]If I'd have let my walls come down
[02:40.82]Maybe I guess we'll never know
[02:44.70]You know, you know
[02:50.09]Before you go
[02:54.40]Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
[03:01.35]If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
[03:05.58]So, before you go
[03:11.61]Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
[03:18.58]It kills me how your mind could make you feel so worthless

[00:08.00]I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
[00:12.80]But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam

[00:23.00]I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
[00:28.00]Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
[00:31.50]No, I didn't get lucky
[00:34.50]But I still felt like a king
[00:38.80]And that might not mean much to you
[00:41.00]But it does to me
[00:46.40]So say I'm a middle of the road
[00:48.80]Not much to show

[00:54.80]But I'm a hell of a lover
[00:57.00]A damn good brother

[01:45.00]But it does to me
[01:47.50]So say I'm a middle of the road
[01:51.00]Not much to show

[03:13.70]That might not mean much to you
[03:18.10]But it does to me
[03:22.30]Oh, it does to me

[00:11.305] *****s sayin' they the G.O.A.T., but I can't buy into the hype
[00:13.755] I dig deep into my spirit when I spit into the mic
[00:16.806] All them sit-downs in that county made me think about my life
[00:19.723] Went through some tragedies, I made it out to make it right (D. Major, baby)
[00:22.806] I was doin' drugs just to get me through the night
[00:25.841] They weren't with me through my struggles, all this shit I sacrificed

[00:43.459] He say them *****s ain't been slidin' and his crown don't fit him
[00:46.425] He want all them *****s dead, it's sad to say, but I feel him
[00:49.427] If I ain't had so much to lose, I'd be riskin' it with him
[00:52.411] Always rap about the guys 'cause I genuinely miss 'em
[00:55.278] Five years later, thousand tears later, still feel like the day when they hit 'em
[00:58.363] Make sure I always say y'all name so ain't no way they forget 'em
[01:02.216] Gon' always feel like **** the opps 'cause *****, I can't forgive 'em

[00:24.133]No pick up lines, I came here tonight to shed a few tears on my own
[00:31.506]But sitting there across the room

[00:38.600]Yeah, my heart might be breaking
[00:40.640]But, this seat ain't taken

[00:49.191]Drownin' the pain is better
[00:52.545]With somebody else who got problems
[00:55.435]We ain't gonna solve 'em
[00:57.098]But misery loves company
[00:59.976]Tonight all I need is a stranger
[01:04.126]Lips with a whiskey chaser
[01:08.066]And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
[01:13.139]Oh, we should be drinkin' alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
[01:20.997]We should be drinkin' alone, together (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
[01:30.404]I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
[01:33.936]But, I know just what to do
[01:37.683]It starts with a bottle of good [?]
[01:41.217]And ends with a shooter or two
[01:45.164]Tomorrow when the sun comes up
[01:47.005]Baby, just forget my name
[01:52.171]Won't be your one and only
[01:54.123]But just 'cause we're lonely don't mean that we should
[01:58.307]We should be drinkin' alone together
[02:03.311]'Cause drownin' the pain is better
[02:06.078]With somebody else who got problems
[02:08.806]We ain't gonna solve 'em
[02:10.670]But misery loves company

[02:26.627]Oh, we should be drinkin' alone
[02:30.142]Drinkin' alone, Drinkin' alone (together)
[02:33.812]Maybe we shouldn't be drinkin' alone (we should be drinking alone)
[02:36.522]Drinkin' alone, Drinkin' alone
[02:40.183]Maybe we shouldn't be drinkin' alone
[02:43.608]I'll pretend that I care
[02:45.415]Baby, pull up a chair
[02:47.113]We'll stay here 'til they make us go home
[02:51.688]We should be drinkin' alone

[03:37.830]Drinkin' alone, Drinkin' alone
[03:40.996]Maybe we shouldn't be drinkin' alone
[03:50.080]We should be drinkin' alone
[00:22.104]A love letter came through the mail, it said, "I miss you"

[00:26.826]I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues

[00:33.188]I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
[00:34.978]I'm confident it won't be one of mine
[00:37.213]I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
[00:39.599]Ain't got no sympathy for no b*tch
[00:41.024]I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
[00:43.073]Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred occasion
[00:45.584]Bro had really f*cked the game up, we made n*ggas shut they trap down
[00:48.297]They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
[00:51.173]See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down

[00:56.806]The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
[00:59.429]The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
[01:02.133]Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
[01:04.797]My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
[01:07.439]I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
[01:10.071]Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
[01:12.193]I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel

[00:17.434]I had a dream
[00:20.969]I got everything I wanted
[00:24.787]Not what you'd think
[00:28.706]And if I'm bein' honest it might've been a nightmare
[00:34.774]To anyone who might care
[00:41.360]Thought I could fly (Fly)
[00:44.662]So I stepped off the Golden, mm
[00:49.236]Nobody cried (Cried)
[00:52.848]Nobody even noticed
[00:55.349]I saw them standing right there
[00:58.984]Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)
[01:01.756]
[01:05.035]I had a dream
[01:08.704]I got everything I wanted
[01:11.872]But when I wake up I see

[01:27.816]Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
[01:36.765]If I could change the way that you see yourself
[01:44.302]You wouldn't wonder why you hear, "They don't deserve you"
[01:51.254]
[01:53.322]I tried to scream
[01:56.572]But my head was underwater
[02:01.290]They called me weak
[02:04.609]Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
[02:06.849]Coulda been a nightmare
[02:10.318]But it felt like they were right there
[02:14.287]And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
[02:19.471]But I don't wanna let anybody know
[02:23.740]'Cause everybody wants something from me now
[02:27.550]And I don't wanna let 'em down

[01:34.62]Forgive and just about forget and take her on a first date again
[01:39.90]And when you lean in for a kiss
[01:42.63]I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
[01:45.89]I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
[01:48.98]I hope you never ever felt more free
[01:51.68]Tell your friends that you're so happy
[01:54.61]I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
[01:58.66]I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
[02:01.81]I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
[02:04.52]She's everything you're ever gonna need
[02:07.24]And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
[02:13.51]And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
[02:20.06]I hope what goes comes all the way around
[02:26.42]I hope she makes you feel the same way
[02:28.94]About her that I feel about you right now
[02:33.49]I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
[02:37.05]I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night

[00:08.281]It's all on me, it's my mistake
[00:12.370]I said I don't love you a little too late
[00:17.299]But I guess there ain't ever a right time
[00:21.358]And I don't know why it's called a "Goodbye"
[00:26.795]Go run my name into the ground
[00:30.740]Tell everyone you know just how
[00:35.553]How I slammed the door on our forever
[00:39.594]But I promise you it's for the better
[00:44.378]I hope you find what you were lookin' for

[01:05.128]And you don't hang me somehow
[01:09.133]'Cause I hope you're happy now
[01:21.670]Who knew this heart could break this hard
[01:25.641]Or a love like ours could fall apart?
[01:30.533]Without so much as a warnin
[01:34.515]I thought that I was what you wanted
[01:39.137]Well, I guess you found what you were lookin' for
[01:47.293]I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
[01:55.744]I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
[01:59.986]And I ain't got nothin' left
[02:04.288]And so I hope you're happy now

[00:03.000](Dmac on the ****in' track)
[00:04.000](Tahj Money)
[00:15.932] I know life is a ***** and she don't fight fair
[00:18.829] How the **** I wake up from a dream to a nightmare?
[00:21.731] Left us behind, you seen that light glare
[00:24.399] I know you walkin' up to Heaven on them white stairs
[00:26.881] Why I can't just pull up to your crib and see you right there?
[00:29.683] Nobody love you 'til you dead, that's when they might care
[00:32.433]
[00:32.578] [Verse 1]
[00:32.714] Let's just be friends before we rush into a label
[00:36.253] Wanna know if you really **** with me, girl, what's your angle?
[00:39.064] It's only for the better if I'm tryna change you
[00:42.131] Lovin' me ain't easy, if you leave, I don't blame you
[00:44.855] Trauma got me ****ed up, so I'm mentally unstable
[00:47.770] I got wrapped up in my emotions, now I'm tangled
[00:50.837] Deep in my thoughts and overthinkin' can get painful
[00:53.684] Watch how I move, one wrong decision can be fatal
[00:56.602] Hidden messages, conversations with my angels
[00:59.502] Just walk with me and you'll see I'm tryna save you
[01:02.322] Most times I'm by myself, I'm still confused from betrayal
[01:05.123] From rags to riches, shit still hard, I'm just on phase two
[01:08.284] Bondin' over drugs and pain, dirty Sprite share
[01:11.139] My dawg was one of a kind, I know your type rare
[01:13.971] I know life is a ***** and she don't fight fair
[01:16.840] How the **** I wake up from a dream to a nightmare?
[01:19.707] Left us behind, you seen that light glare
[01:22.573] I know you walkin' up to Heaven on them white stairs
[01:25.025] Why I can't just pull up to your crib and see you right there?
[01:27.944] Nobody love you 'til you dead, that's when they might care
[01:30.557]
[01:30.740] [Verse 2]
[01:30.838] Livin' on his own and he runnin' out of options now
[01:34.542] 'Cause he felt like he couldn't be hisself at his mama house
[01:37.457] Hittin' licks, missin' school, junior year, he thought 'bout droppin' out
[01:40.693] Him against the world, 40 on him when he poppin' out
[01:43.675] On his dark road, he just tryna find a proper route
[01:46.543] Hate the criticism, he uses music to block it out
[01:49.557] By his auntie, he was molested as a baby boy
[01:51.791] Messed up his head, it even changed the way he play with toys
[01:54.714] Up late night rappin' and they told him to quit makin' noise
[01:57.630] Stuck in his feelings, he be spendin' every day annoyed
[02:00.594] He wanna stand over a *****, leave his face destroyed
[02:03.660] He miss his hood, now this something that he can't avoid
[02:06.625] Bondin' over drugs and pain, dirty Sprite share
[02:09.265] My dawg was one of a kind, I know your type rare
[02:12.135] I know life is a ***** and she don't fight fair
[02:14.949] How the **** I wake up from a dream to a nightmare?
[02:17.996] Left us behind, you seen that light glare
[02:20.699] I know you walkin' up to Heaven on them white stairs
[02:23.180] Why I can't just pull up to your crib and see you right there?
[02:26.131] Nobody love you 'til you dead, that's when they might care
[00:12.746] Yeah, baby
[00:14.516] Out here, ain't nothin' but woods and water
[00:18.052] Drop a beer from a stand, catch a fish with a bobber
[00:21.383] Drink a beer out the can, liquor out the bottle
[00:24.764] How the good Lord intended it
[00:27.446] Yes, he did
[00:28.776] I love my country
[00:30.403] I love my country
[00:32.004] Six strings and fiddles
[00:33.463] Whiskey from Kentucky
[00:35.563] We keep it funky, we like how it sounds
[00:38.832] Monday to Sunday, yeah, I love my country
[00:42.228] Up loud and proud, rollin' into town
[00:45.501] Hangin' out the window like a bluetick hound
[00:48.703] Ain't sorry, ain't nothin' to be sorry about
[00:52.546] I love my country
[00:54.332] I love my country up loud
[01:03.238] Barbecue, steak fries
[01:04.729] Styrofoam, plate date night
[01:06.519] George Strait singin' greats while we're turnin' up sittin' lake side
[01:09.791] That pedal steel, she's straight slidin' over here to me
[01:12.366] She do that Alabama shake, like you ain't ever seen
[01:16.837] I love my country
[01:18.421] I love my country
[01:20.072] Six strings and fiddles
[01:21.351] Whiskey from Kentucky
[01:23.430] We keep it funky, we like how it sounds
[01:26.747] Monday to Sunday, yeah, I love my country
[01:29.984] Up loud and proud, rollin' into town
[01:33.673] Hangin' out the window like a bluetick hound
[01:36.758] Ain't sorry, ain't nothin' to be sorry about
[01:40.495] I love my country
[01:42.342] I love my country up loud
[01:49.352] I love my country up loud
[01:53.056] I'm talkin' way up loud
[01:57.285] I like pop and rock and rap
[01:59.002] I like Skynyrd
[02:00.675] And goin' out downtown when I'm with her
[02:04.186] Like drivin' too fast down a four-lane road
[02:07.520] But damn sure nowhere close to the way that
[02:11.577] I love my country
[02:13.074] I love my country
[02:14.736] Six strin's and fiddles
[02:16.231] Whiskey from Kentucky
[02:17.981] We keep it funky, we like how it sounds
[02:21.712] Monday to Sunday, yeah, I love my country
[02:24.936] Up Loud and proud, rollin' into town

[02:31.623] Ain't sorry, ain't nothin' to be sorry about
[02:35.393] I love my country
[02:37.223] I love my country up loud
[02:41.156] (Yeah, baby)
[02:44.289] I love my country up loud
[02:48.289] Yeah, way up loud
[02:53.709] That's a country ass lyric right there, boy
[02:56.737] Haha
[02:59.259] Yee!
[00:05.49]I was distracted and in traffic
[00:09.53]I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
[00:12.11]But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
[00:15.64]Were you in the living room, chillin' watchin' television?
[00:19.28]It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
[00:22.27]How to let you go and let communication die out
[00:25.43]I know you know we know
[00:28.68]You weren't down for forever and it's fine
[00:32.26]I know you know we know
[00:34.77]We weren't meant for each other and it's fine
[00:38.77]But if the world was ending you'd come over, right?
[00:41.79]You'd come over and you'd stay the night
[00:45.32]Would you love me for the hell of it?
[00:48.18]All our fears would be irrelevant
[00:51.83]If the world was ending you'd come over right?
[00:54.78]The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
[00:58.16]And there wouldn't be a reason why
[01:01.04]We would even have to say goodbye
[01:04.71]If the world was ending you'd come over, right? Right?
[01:10.42]If the world was ending you'd come over, right? Right?
[01:16.83]I tried to imagine your reaction
[01:21.53]It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
[01:24.60]But it really got me thinkin', that night we went drinkin'
[01:27.65]Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen
[01:30.80]Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how
[01:34.05]How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out
[01:37.22]I know you know we know
[01:40.68]You weren't down for forever and it's fine
[01:44.25]I know you know we know
[01:46.85]We weren't meant for each other and it's fine
[01:50.87]But if the world was ending you'd come over, right?
[01:54.05]You'd come over and you'd stay the night
[01:57.51]Would you love me for the hell of it?
[02:00.39]All our fears would be irrelevant
[02:04.05]If the world was ending you'd come over, right?
[02:07.15]The sky'd be falling while I'd hold you tight
[02:10.38]No, there wouldn't be a reason why
[02:13.07]We would even have to say goodbye
[02:16.92]If the world was ending you'd come over, right?
[02:20.08]You'd come over, right? You'd come over,
[02:22.76]You'd come over, you'd come over, right?
[02:30.55]I know you know we know
[02:33.56]You weren't down for forever and it's fine
[02:37.45]I know you know we know
[02:39.64]We weren't meant for each other and it's fine
[02:43.92]But if the world was ending you'd come over, right?
[02:48.93]You'd come over and you'd stay the night
[02:51.77]Would you love me for the hell of it?
[02:54.60]All our fears would be irrelevant
[02:58.14]If the world was ending you'd come over, right?
[03:01.62]The sky'd be falling while I'd hold you tight
[03:04.68]No there wouldn't be a reason why
[03:07.65]We would even have to say goodbye
[03:11.17]If the world was ending you'd come over, right?
[03:16.46]You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?
[03:19.56]Hmm, yeah if the world was ending you'd come over, right?
[00:15.31]I'm a little bit a ball cap
[00:17.36]Little bit a pearl snap button down shirt
[00:23.68]Little bit a big city concrete
[00:26.24]But a lot more small town dirt
[00:31.18]I can see your pretty eyes reading me like a map
[00:35.21]Wondering who I am and where I'm at
[00:40.28]I'm in between
[00:45.16]Friday night wild and quiet Sunday morning
[00:48.79]Between
[00:53.04]Done after one, and keep on pouring
[00:56.86]Ain't too high, ain't too low
[01:00.65]Just holding down the middle, I'm steady as I go
[01:04.62]I ain't all holy water, and I ain't all Jim Dean
[01:10.57]I'm somewhere in between
[01:19.85]I can be a steel toe work boot
[01:22.40]40 hour blue collar, mud on my jeans
[01:28.29]Then on weekend pack a bag
[01:30.27]Disappear kick back on a white sand beach
[01:36.09]I'm a far cry from being a one night stand
[01:39.95]But I ain't ready for a ring on my hand
[01:45.17]I'm in between
[01:50.07]Friday night wild and quiet Sunday morning
[01:53.65]Between
[01:57.89]Done after one, and keep on pouring
[02:01.77]Ain't too high, ain't too low
[02:05.53]Just holding down the middle, I'm steady as I go
[02:09.47]I ain't all holy water, and I ain't all Jim Dean
[02:15.49]I'm somewhere in between
[02:33.13]I can see your pretty eyes reading me like a map

[03:06.47]I ain't all holy water, and I ain't all Jim Dean
[03:12.60]I'm somewhere in between
[03:20.43]Yeah I'm somewhere in between
[00:14.94]I just pretend that I'm in the dark
[00:24.32]I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
[00:33.49]I'd rather be so oblivious
[00:38.45]I'd rather be with you
[00:43.80]When it's said, when it's done, yeah
